### Briefly About Myself:
I am currently a C++ developer, creating and fixing bugs in existing applications of the company I work for. We develop client-server applications for various platforms, such as Windows and Linux.
Recently, I began to understand that it's time to go to my dream and focus on web development.
C++ is a very complex and interesting programming language, but the development of web interfaces has always been of greater interest to me.
### Skills and Proficiency:
* C++
* OOP
* Javascript base
* CSS
* HTML
* Git
* VSCode
### Code example:
As an example of the code, I will give one of the tasks of c Codewars with the following condition:  
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

    function isPangram(s){
    const alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    const regex = /\s/g;
    const lowercase = s.toLowerCase().replace(regex, "");
    
    for(let i = 0; i < alphabet.length; i++){
        if(lowercase.indexOf(alphabet[i]) === -1){
        return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
    }
